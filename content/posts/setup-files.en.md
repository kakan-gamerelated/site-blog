# Setup Server Files

Find the link to download server files as well as our discord server [here](/links)

Press `Win + R` to open the run menu and paste this in that: 

	%APPDATA%\VCMP\04beta\store\

and press Enter. That should open a folder with many numbers

Once there, create a folder with this exact name: 

	65.2.65.211-8192

Inside the folder, extract the zip files. If the folder already exists, you can still just paste these files inside!

After successfully pasting the files, it should look something like this:
